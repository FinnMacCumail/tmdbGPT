# Company/Studio Query Fixes - Summary Report

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: Company and network queries like "HBO shows" and "Movies by Marvel Studios" returned empty results `[]`.

**Root Cause**: Single entity company/network queries were using constraint-based approach instead of symbol-free routing, causing validation failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Entity Resolution Fix
- **Fixed HBO resolution**: Now resolves to US HBO (ID 49, 375+ shows) instead of Polish HBO (ID 8102, 0 shows)
- **Added US origin preference** for network entities in `entity_resolution.py`

### 2. Symbol-Free Routing Implementation
- **Extended detection logic**: Added single company/network entity detection to `is_symbol_free_query()`
- **Direct routing**: Route company/network queries directly to discover endpoints with proper parameters
- **Bypassed constraint validation**: Avoid constraint building that fails for single entity queries

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files:
1. **`core/entity/entity_resolution.py`**:
   - Added US origin preference for network entity resolution
   - Prevents resolution to wrong international networks

2. **`core/planner/plan_utils.py`**:
   - Extended `is_symbol_free_query()` to detect single company/network queries
   - Added direct routing in `route_symbol_free_intent()`:
     - Companies → `/discover/movie?with_companies={id}`
     - Networks → `/discover/tv?with_networks={id}`

## Results

### Before Fix:
```
"HBO shows" → [] (No results found)
"Movies by Marvel Studios" → [] (No results found)
```

### After Fix:
```
"HBO shows" → ✅ 21 HBO TV shows (Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, Euphoria, etc.)
"Movies by Marvel Studios" → ✅ 21 Marvel movies (Deadpool & Wolverine, Thunderbolts*, etc.)
```

## Test Results ✅

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ HBO Shows: 21 results returned
- ✅ Marvel Movies: 21 results returned
- ✅ Symbol-free routing activated correctly
- ✅ Direct discover endpoints used with proper parameters

## Pattern Established

This fix establishes the pattern for handling single entity queries that was already successful for:
- TV role queries: "Who starred in Breaking Bad?" → Direct `/tv/{id}/credits`
- Movie role queries: "Who wrote Inception?" → Direct `/movie/{id}/credits`

Now extended to:
- Company queries: "Movies by [Studio]" → Direct `/discover/movie?with_companies={id}`
- Network queries: "[Network] shows" → Direct `/discover/tv?with_networks={id}`

## Impact

**Query Types Now Working Excellently:**
- TV Show Role Queries ✅
- Movie Role Queries ✅  
- TV Show Counts ✅
- Movie Facts ✅
- Single Entity Info ✅
- Multi-Entity Constraints ✅ (existing)
- **Company/Studio Queries ✅ (NEW)**

This resolves the major "Improving" status issue identified in the remaining problematic query categories analysis, moving company/studio queries from failing to excellent performance.
