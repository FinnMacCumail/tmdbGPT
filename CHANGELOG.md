Previous versions (1.x.x series) were developed in the `reorg` branch with extensive debugging and experimental features. These releases included:

- Multi-step query planner with semantic search
- ChromaDB vector storage for endpoint matching
- Symbolic constraint planning and validation
- Role-aware entity resolution
