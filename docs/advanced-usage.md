# TV Show Information
"When did Breaking Bad first air?" # ‚Üí 2008
"When did The Office first air?"   # ‚Üí 2005
```

## Advanced Query Techniques

### ‚úÖ Multi-Entity Constraint Queries (Working Well - Recent Testing Shows Strong Performance)

TMDBGPT handles sophisticated queries involving multiple constraints. Recent testing shows excellent performance on actor+director combinations, though results vary by constraint complexity:

#### Triple Constraint Queries
```bash
# Person + Genre + Time Period
"Science fiction movies directed by Ridley Scott from the 1980s"

# Multiple People + Company
"Marvel movies with both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr"

# Network + Genre + Rating
"HBO crime dramas with ratings above 8.0"
```

#### Role-Specific Multi-Person Queries
```bash
# Different roles for different people
"Movies written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze"

# Same person, different roles
"Movies where Ben Affleck was both actor and director"

# Multiple people, same role
"Movies directed by both the Coen Brothers"
```

### Query Pattern Optimization

#### Using Semantic Variations

TMDBGPT understands various phrasings:

```bash
# All equivalent queries:
"Movies directed by Christopher Nolan"
"Films by Christopher Nolan" 
"Christopher Nolan's filmography"
"What movies has Christopher Nolan directed?"
```

#### Leveraging Constraint Relaxation

Structure queries to take advantage of automatic fallback:

```bash
# Primary query with fallback potential
"Thrillers directed by David Fincher"

# System will progressively relax:
# 1. Remove director constraint (show all thrillers)
# 2. Keep thriller genre (core constraint)
# 3. Fallback to similar genres if needed
```

## Advanced Features

### Debug Mode Analysis

Enable comprehensive debugging for query analysis:

```python
# In app.py
DEBUG_MODE = True
```

#### Understanding Debug Output

**Entity Resolution Analysis**:
```
üßæ Extracted Entities:
   - Christopher Nolan (person, role=director) ‚Üí 525
   - Leonardo DiCaprio (person, role=actor) ‚Üí 6193
```

**Constraint Tree Evaluation**:
```
üìê Constraint Tree:
ConstraintGroup([
  Constraint(with_people, [525, 6193], AND),
  Constraint(person_roles, {525: director, 6193: actor}, AND)
], logic=AND)
```

**Execution Trace**:
```
üß≠ Completed Steps (8):
   - step_extract_entities
   - step_resolve_person_525
   - step_resolve_person_6193
   - step_director_525_movie
   - step_actor_6193_movie
   - step_discover_intersection
   - step_validate_movie_12345
   - step_validate_movie_67890
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Query Structure for Speed

**Faster Queries**:
- Be specific with names: "Christopher Nolan" vs "Nolan"
- Use common entity types: people, genres, years
- Avoid overly complex multi-layered constraints

**Slower Queries**:
- Vague references: "that director who made Inception"
- Unusual entity combinations
- Very broad date ranges

#### Caching Strategies

Enable aggressive caching for repeated queries:

```python
# In configuration
CACHE_ENTITY_RESOLUTIONS = True
CACHE_API_RESPONSES = True
EMBEDDING_CACHE_SIZE = 2000
```

### üéÜ Technical Architecture Improvements (August 2025)

#### Symbol-Free Routing System ‚ú® NEW

**Technical Details**:
- **Detection**: Queries like "Who starred in Breaking Bad?" identified as single-entity fact queries
- **Routing**: Direct routing to `/tv/{id}?append_to_response=credits` instead of complex constraint planning
- **Benefits**: Faster execution, more accurate results, comprehensive role data

**Examples of Symbol-Free Routing**:
```python
# Query: "Who created Breaking Bad?"
# Old Path: Complex constraint planning ‚Üí Often failed
# New Path: Direct TV lookup ‚Üí /tv/1396?append_to_response=credits ‚Üí Success

# Query: "Who wrote Inception?" 
# Old Path: Generic discovery ‚Üí Incomplete data
# New Path: Direct movie lookup ‚Üí /movie/27205?append_to_response=credits ‚Üí Complete crew
```

#### Enhanced Credits API Integration 
**Complete Role Support**: All TMDB crew roles now extracted and supported:

**Movie Roles Supported**:
- Directors, Writers (screenplay/story), Composers, Producers
- Executive Producers, Original Music Composers
- Main Cast (top 5 for performance)

**TV Show Roles Supported**:
- Creators, Showrunners, Executive Producers
- Writers, Producers, Co-Executive Producers  
- Main Cast (top 5 for performance)

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Enhanced extraction logic
def _extract_movie_details(json_data, endpoint):
    # Extract all crew roles from credits API
    for crew_member in json_data["credits"].get("crew", []):
        job = crew_member.get("job", "").lower()
        if job == "director":
            directors.append(name)
        elif job in ["writer", "screenplay", "story"]:
            writers.append(name)
        elif job in ["original music composer", "composer"]:
            composers.append(name)
        # ... additional role extraction
```

#### Intent Correction System 

**Problem Solved**: LLM sometimes misclassifies TV shows as movies or vice versa, causing routing failures.

**Solution**: Automatic intent correction for role-based queries:
```python
# Example correction logic
if tv_entities and "details.movie" in intents:
    # Correct movie intent to TV for shows
    intents.remove("details.movie")
    intents.append("details.tv")
```

**Impact**: Eliminates classification-based failures for TV role queries.

#### Enhanced Fact Extraction Pipeline 

**Keyword-Based Detection**: Intelligent fact type detection based on query keywords:

```python
# New fact detection logic
is_runtime_question = any(keyword in query_text for keyword in 
    ["long", "runtime", "duration", "minutes", "hours"])
is_genre_question = any(keyword in query_text for keyword in 
    ["genre", "type of", "kind of", "category"])
is_director_question = any(keyword in query_text for keyword in 
    ["direct", "director", "directed"])
```

**Field Prioritization**: Query-specific field extraction prioritization:
- Runtime queries ‚Üí Extract and return runtime field first
- Genre queries ‚Üí Extract and format genre list
- Role queries ‚Üí Extract comprehensive crew/cast information

### Custom Query Patterns

#### Using Natural Language Patterns

**Enhanced TV Role Patterns**
```bash
# Creator/Showrunner Queries
"Who created [Show]?"
"Who developed [Show]?"
"[Show] was created by who?"

# Cast and Crew Queries  
"Who starred in [Show]?"
"Cast of [Show]"
"Who wrote [Show]?"
"Who produced [Show]?"
```

**Enhanced Movie Role Patterns**
```bash
# Comprehensive Crew Queries
"Who wrote [Movie]?"
"Who composed [Movie]?"
"Who produced [Movie]?"
"Music by whom in [Movie]?"
"[Movie] director?"
```

**Enhanced Fact Patterns**
```bash
# Technical Details
"How long is [Movie]?"
"Runtime of [Movie]"
"What genre is [Movie]?"
"Budget of [Movie]?"

# TV Attributes
"How many seasons [Show]?"
"Episode count [Show]"
```

**Statistical Queries**:
```bash
"How many movies has Quentin Tarantino directed?"
"How many seasons does Breaking Bad have?" ‚ú®
"How many episodes does The Office have?" ‚ú®
```

        self.max_size = max_size
    
    def get_cache_key(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Generate cache key for query."""
        return hashlib.md5(query.lower().encode()).hexdigest()
    
    def get(self, query: str) -> Optional[dict]:
        """Get cached result."""
        key = self.get_cache_key(query)
        return self.cache.get(key)
    
    def set(self, query: str, result: dict):
        """Cache result."""
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            # Remove oldest entries (simple FIFO)
            oldest_key = next(iter(self.cache))
            del self.cache[oldest_key]
        
        key = self.get_cache_key(query)
        self.cache[key] = result
```

    # Process query
    graph = build_app_graph()
    result = graph.invoke({"input": query})
    
    profiler.disable()
    
    # Analyze results
    stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
    stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
    stats.print_stats(20)  # Top 20 functions
    
    return result
```
